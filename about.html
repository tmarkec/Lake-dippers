                    <p> Group "Lake dippers" started more than 10 years ago through anual event which is held on
                         St.Stephens day (26th of December).Local people from Killarney would meet at Dundag beach
                         in National Park Killarney and bravely dug into freezing cold water. There was also some marathon swimm
                         events during summer months. Idea behind it was to promote healthy aspect of life, and to build stronger 
                         community in Killarney. Over years our group gained more than 
                         50 members who regularly on weekly basis goes for swimm no matter what weather conditions are. Don't be 
                         surprised if you come across group of people in the middle of the January. Most usual meeting point is Dundag Beach,
                          but there have been days when group would meet on other lakes.
                          You don't have to be good swimmer to join the group and to dip in the cold lake in the winter :).

                      Absolutely love every single bit of this small community. Been going out with this lovely
                      bunch for years now, and I can tell that I really made friends over the years. I can't 
                      think a week without going for even just a short 'dip' in the lake.

                        I've visited Killarney with my familly for 2 weeks, and I found this bunch on my 
                        last few days of the trip. It's great to have company for some morning swims and my
                        only regret is that I haven't come across this group sooner.

                      good friends, and I guess beeing swimming coach for years helped me and the 
                      group with our activities and annual events over the years.

                        There is no words to describe this lovely group. Even though I'm not good 
                        swimmer, I have no fear when I'm souranded with 'Lake dippers'. Love that
                        crazy bunch who couldn't care less if it's freezing outside or not. They will
                        dip into the lake :).
